== Red Hat OpenShift API Designer

As part of the API-First approach, the first step  - of course - is to to design those APIs. API Designer is a tool to design your APIs (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI) and schemas (Apache Avro, Google Protobuf, JSON Schema). You can manage your collection of API and schema designs by creating, importing, and editing. Save your work by downloading your designs locally or by exporting them to OpenShift Service Registry. 

In this section you will import an existing API that will be used as a starting point, explore the designer while making a few minor edits and then export this to a Service Registry

API Designer is under `Service preview` and can be accessed through the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console via this https://console.redhat.com/beta/application-services/api-designer[API Designer,role=external,window=_blank]

[NOTE]
====
OpenShift API Designer is in Beta and all your designs are stored locally in your browser. Clearing your browser cache or switching to a new browser might result in loss of data. Make sure you save your work by downloading your designs locally or by exporting them to a Red Hat OpenShift Service Registry instance.
