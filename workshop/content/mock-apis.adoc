== Setting up mocks to help with parallel development

Now that  the OpenAPI specs are finalised, creatoion of API mocks will enable parallel development streams leading to rapid inner loop development. 

* UI developers and other app dev teams (such as mobile dev) do not need to wait for the APIs to be completely developed and instead can use these mocks to get realistic responses. 

* Backend developers in parallel build the backend applications APIs using modern cloud-native frameworks such as https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus]. They can test against the OpenAPI specs to ensure their implementation does not break the specifications.  

There are a number of ways to mock APIs including microcks, postman etc. In this labs you will use  hosted Postman.


=== Setup Postman
. Access Postman at https://www.postman.com/. Click on `Sign Up for Free`
. You can now either create a new user or Sign-up with Google. 
+

. You can provide your name and other details after signing in if prompted
. You will be prompted with a `How would you like to start` popup if this is the first time you are logging in. You can ignore this prompt

. Navigate to  the `Homepage and click on `Import file-->`
+

=== Import the ProductCatalogAPI API

. You will now see the `Import wizard`  with mutiple options
+

. The next step is to import the OpenAPI spec from Service Registry. 
* Navigate to the https://console.redhat.com/beta/application-services/service-registry[Service Registry]. Login with Red Hat account if necessary.
* Navigate to the `globex` instance and there onto `globex / ProductCatalogAPI`. 
* You can either retrieve the specs as OpenAPI spec as (a) *raw text* or (b) *a file* and then import this into Postman.

.. *If you are importing OpenAPI spec as raw text*
+
** In the `Service Registry` browser tab, click on the `Content` tab. Copy the specifications content shown in this page into the memory (Ctrl-A and Ctrl-C).
+

** Navigate to the `Postman window browser tab` which is already open.
** Click on the `Content` option of the `Import` popup and paste the content from the memory (Ctrl-V) into the textarea.
+

** Click on Continue 

.. *If you are importing OpenAPI spec as file*
+
** In the `Service Registry` browser tab, click on the `Documentation` tab. Click on the `*Download*` button. Make a note of where the file is downloaded in your laptop
+

** Navigate back to the `Postman window browser tab` where you have `Import` wizard open.
** Click on the `File` option of the `Import` wizard.
+

** You can either drag the file into this window or clik on `Upload Files`to import the file downloaded from Service Registry
** You will be auto-navigated to the next step

. You will now see the API's name and a few other details populated the `Import` wizard
+

. Click on `Import`. 
. You will be notified that `Import complete`. Click `Close` button.
. Explore the `OrdePlacement API` that has been imported.
** Note that the Collections and APIs are prepopulated

=== Setup Postman mock server
. The next step is to setup a mock server on Postman which will then showcase how it can be useful for developers while the actual API backend is under developement too.
. Click on `Mock Servers` on the left-hand navigation, and choose the `Create Mock Server` option
+

. On the right pane, choose `Select an existing collection`, and then choose `ProductCatalogAPI`
+
image:images/postman-mock-chooseapi.png[]
. Give the mock server a name `ProductCatalog Mock Server` and click on `Create Mock Server` at the bottom of the  page.
+
image::images/postman-mock-create-server.png[]
. You will be shown details of the mock server URL. Make a note of that.
+

=== Test the imported API using the mock server
. Explore  `Collections` menu from the left hand side, and you will be able to see the examples that been already created while the API was designed.
. Click on the `Get list of product by id` from the Collections. This opens a tab on Postman which you can use to issue a request
+
image::images/postman-choose-prodbyid.png[] 

. Replace the `{{baseUrl}}` in the address field with the Mock server's URL, and click `Send`
. You can view the list of products in the bottom panel. Note that the name of the Quarkus T-shirt now says `Jaya's Awesome Quarkus T-shirt` (or the name  you have to this product)

In the next step you will learn to protect the API by using Red Hat OpenShift API Management.
